Sample text:



Twinkle, twinkle, hello star

How I hello what you hello
Up above hello world so hello
Like a hello in the hello
Twinkle, twinkle hello star

How I hello what you hello


When the hello sun is hello
When he hello shines upon

Then you hello your little hello
Twinkle, twinkle, hello the night

Twinkle, twinkle, hello star

How I hello what you hello
